# Google Photos Takeout Util

_NOTE: This project is in development. It cannot be used at this moment. Feel free to create issues with features you hope to see, and I will consider adding them to the feature list below!_

## Disclaimers

This project has no affiliation with Google and is not endorsed by them. This is my own personal project that I made to solve a problem I had with Google Photos.

It is also currently in development and might contain bugs. You are welcome to try it though, it may work for you! If it does not, and you are interested in helping out, please create an "issue" for this project here in GitHub if you find a bug.

## What is this?

This tool provides useful utilities for photos exported from Google Photos Takeout.

## Features

- [ ] Attach metadata such as time stamp and geolocation to photos from the JSON files included in the Google Photos Takeout zip file
- [ ] Convert some, all, or none of the photos to a singular image file format (such as JPEG or PNG)

## Why?

This application is inspired by the paid tool, [Google Photos Metadata Fixer](https://metadatafixer.com/) and is a rewrite and extension of [google-photos-metadata-fixer](https://github.com/joshua-holmes/google-photos-metadata-fix). I wanted to provide a free open-source alternative that provides intuitive features and is easy to use.
